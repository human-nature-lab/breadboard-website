(For Non-Profit Academic and/or Research Institutions)

5 April, 2016

By using the software provided, RECIPIENT agrees as follows:

I. Definitions:

1. YALE: Yale University, a corporation organized and existing under and by virtue of a charter granted by the General Assembly of the Colony and State of Connecticut and located in New Haven, Connecticut

2. YALE SCIENTIST: Nicholas Christakis

3. RECIPIENT: The recipient of the PROGRAM.

4. PROGRAM: Breadboard

5. DERIVATIVES: computer software and related documentation created by or on behalf of RECIPIENT that includes, or is based in whole or in part on, the PROGRAMS, including, but not limited to, translations of the PROGRAMS to other foreign or computer languages, adaptations of the PROGRAMS to other hardware platforms, abridgments, condensations, revisions, and software incorporating all or any part of the PROGRAMS, and which may also include modifications, enhancements or other RECIPIENT or third party software.

6. COMMERCIAL PURPOSES: The commercial development, use, manufacture or distribution of the PROGRAM, or the sale, lease, license, or other transfer of the PROGRAM or DERIVATIVES to a for-profit organization.

II. Terms and Conditions of this Agreement:

1. YALE retains all ownership rights in the PROGRAM, including any part of the PROGRAM contained or incorporated in DERIVATIVES, and including but not limited to, patent rights, copyrights and licensing rights therein, and further intends that no license, expressed or implied, for use other than herein set out shall be transferred hereby.

2. The RECIPIENT and the RECIPIENT SCIENTIST agree that the PROGRAM:

    (a) is to be used solely for teaching and academic research purposes;

    (b) is to be used only by RECIPIENT or others working under his/her direct supervision;

3. The RECIPIENT agrees to refer to YALE SCIENTIST any request for the PROGRAM from anyone other than those persons working under the RECIPIENT's direct supervision

4. Except as provided in this Agreement, no express or implied licenses or other rights are provided to the RECIPIENT under any patents, patent applications, trade secrets or other proprietary rights of YALE, including any altered forms of the PROGRAM made by YALE. In particular, no express or implied licenses or other rights are provided to use the PROGRAM, DERIVATIVES, or any related patents of YALE for COMMERCIAL PURPOSES.

5. If the RECIPIENT desires to use or license the PROGRAM or DERIVATIVES for COMMERCIAL PURPOSES, the RECIPIENT agrees, in advance of such use, to negotiate in good faith with YALE to establish the terms of a commercial license. It is understood by the RECIPIENT that YALE shall have no obligation to grant such a license to the RECIPIENT, and may grant exclusive or non-exclusive commercial licenses to others, or sell or assign all or part of the rights in the PROGRAM to any third party(ies), subject to any pre-existing rights held by others and obligations to the Federal Government.

6. The RECIPIENT acknowledges that DERIVATIVES for COMMERCIAL PURPOSES may require a commercial license from YALE.

7. RECIPIENT acknowledges that any copies of the PROGRAM or portions thereof shall include a YALE copyright notice thereon.  The notice shall be affixed to all copies or portions thereof in such manner and location as to give reasonable notice of YALE's claim of copyright and shall be in the following format: "Copyright 2014 Yale University.  All rights reserved." or "&copy; 2014 YALE All Rights Reserved."

8. The RECIPIENT is free to file patent application(s) claiming inventions made by the RECIPIENT through the use of the PROGRAM, but agrees to notify YALE upon filing a patent application claiming DERIVATIVES of the PROGRAM.

9. The PROGRAM is a research program, and YALE does not represent that it is free of errors or bugs or suitable for any particular tasks. RECIPIENT accepts the PROGRAM on an "AS IS" basis.  Accordingly, YALE shall not be required to load the PROGRAM onto RECIPIENT's machines, test for proper operation, perform any debugging, make any corrections, provide maintenance, provide any updates, or assist in the understanding or use of the PROGRAM.

10. RECIPIENT AGREES THAT THE RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER ARE MADE AVAILABLE WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND FURTHER INCLUDING NO WARRANTY AS TO CONFORMITY WITH WHATEVER USER MANUALS OR OTHER LITERATURE MAY BE ISSUED FROM TIME TO TIME.  NOTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE CONSTRUED AS A REPRESENTATION MADE OR WARRANTY GIVEN BY YALE THAT THE PRACTICE BY RECIPIENT OF THE LICENSE GRANTED HEREUNDER SHALL NOT INFRINGE THE PATENT RIGHTS, COPYRIGHTS, OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF ANY THIRD PARTY.  IN NO EVENT SHALL YALE, ITS TRUSTEES, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, STUDENTS, OR ASSOCIATES BE LIABLE FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING ECONOMIC DAMAGE OR INJURY TO PROPERTY AND LOST PROFITS, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER YALE SHALL BE ADVISED, SHALL HAVE OTHER REASON TO KNOW, OR IN FACT SHALL KNOW OF THE POSSIBILITY.

11. RECIPIENT shall at all times during the term of this Agreement and thereafter, indemnify, defend and hold harmless YALE, its trustees, directors, officers, employees, agents, students, and affiliates, against all claims, proceedings, demands, and liabilities of any kind whatsoever, including legal expenses and reasonable attorneys' fees, arising out of, connected with, resulting from or sustained as a result of use of the Program by LICENSEE.  In no event shall YALE be liable for special, direct, indirect or consequential damages, losses, costs, charges, claims, demands, fees or expenses of any nature or kind.  

12. This agreement shall not be interpreted to prevent or delay publication by RECIPIENT of research findings resulting from the use of the PROGRAM or the DERIVATIVES.

13. RECIPIENT shall not use the PROGRAM title or the names or trademarks of Yale University, nor any adaptation thereof, nor the names of any of their employees, in any advertising, promotional or sales literature without prior written consent obtained from YALE in each case, except as specified in #14.

14. RECIPIENT agrees to provide appropriate acknowledgement of the source of the PROGRAM in all professional journals and publications using the statement that data were collected using "the software package breadboard created by the Human Nature Lab at Yale University (breadboard.yale.edu)". RECIPIENT is kindly requested to notify YALE SCIENTIST of such publications or research findings.
