# Managing qualifications

### The Manage qualifications tab allows you to associate a custom qualification with your experiment to track AMT workers and prevent repeat play.

To get started with breadboard participant qualifications, click the AMT dialog and select the Manage qualifications tab.

Select your experiment and click the 'Add qualification type' button to create a new qualification type associated with your experiment.

Click the 'Add participants' button to preload in a list of worker IDs who have previously participated in your experiment.

You can paste the worker IDs into the text area or load them from a text file with one worker ID per line.

After adding qualifications to previous players you can limit workers who can discover, preview, and accept your HIT by using the Qualification requirements section of the Create HIT form.

To prevent previous participants from previewing, or accepting your HIT select the 'participant' qualification associated with your experiment's name, select 'Does not exist' from the comparator drop-down and select 'Preview and accept' from the actions guarded drop-down.

![Requirements not met](https://github.com/human-nature-lab/breadboard/wiki/images/manage-qualifications/qualifications_7.png)

Participants with the associated qualification will receive a 'Requirements not met' message and will be unable to preview or accept the HIT.

After running an instance of your experiment you can quickly assign the qualification to your workers by using the 'Assign qualification' checkbox in the Manage HITs tab.
