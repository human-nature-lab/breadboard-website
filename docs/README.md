  Go to the [upgrade guide](upgrade-guide) for more information.
:::

In fields as diverse as computational sociology, behavioral economics, and social psychology, researchers conduct experiments where they place participants in networks of their own design, with rules of interactions of their own devising, in order to play repeated games where participants' actions affect others they are connected with.

Using breadboard, researchers can rapidly design new experiments using a flexible domain specific language. The code is stored in the database and changes can be previewed and tested immediately without having to recompile and redeploy software. The network is visualized in real-time which makes it easy for an administrator to see the global behaviors of the network as a whole.

When an experiment is ready, an administrator can use breadboard to post a job to Amazon Mechanical Turk, an online crowdsourcing marketplace. Amazon Mechanical Turk provides us immediate access to a diverse pool of participants from around the world. Within minutes of posting the experiment we can gather a large group of participants to play the game.
